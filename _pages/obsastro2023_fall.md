## The Goal of this Course

In the last decade, a series of ground-breaking astronomical discoveries have stepped into the spotlight of science and collected a bucketload of Nobel Physics medals. Do you know which surreal technology enables the confirmation of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy? Can you imagine the challenges astronomers faced when they searched for the first exoplanet? And do you understand the amount of effort behind the observational evidence for "accelerated expansion of the Universe"? "Astronomy is a discipline based on observation." And, in this course, we will show you what it means. 

This course will give you a panoramic view of the landscape of modern astronomical observation, including some of the frontlines of observational astrophysics. We will focus on the optical/infrared observations and cover the basics of the multi-wavelength and multi-messenger sides of the subject. This course will give a basic grasp of fundamental concepts and methods of observational astronomy. You will also taste actual observation and essential data reduction through a small project. 

This course will primarily cover the following four topics: 1. Observation: What is astronomical observation? Why do these observations? What did astronomers in history observe? And what are today's astrophysics targets? 2. Measurement: What are astronomers measuring during the observation? How do they achieve it? What fundamental space, time, and energy reference systems support all the cutting-edge observations? 3. Instrument: What equipment and instruments are essential for modern observation? And which exciting technologies are involved? 4. Methodology: How do the data collected during the observation become "science"? What are the common senses and universal logics in this critical data reduction step?

## Textbook 

- [<To Measure the Sky: An Introduction to Observational Astronomy>](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/to-measure-the-sky/92996E5636A4EFD6562DF94AE947C908#overview) by Frederick R. Chromey, Cambridge University Press, 2016.
    - Tsinghua students can have access to this book through the [iTextbook service provided by the library](https://www.itextbook.cn/f/book/bookDetail?bookId=aedee3e3e130478aa41279b5625a102a)
- [<Observational Astronomy: Techniques and Instrumentation>](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/physics/observational-astronomy-techniques-and-instrumentation/observational-astronomy-techniques-and-instrumentation?format=HB&isbn=9781107010468#:~:text=This%20book%20is%20a%20comprehensive,of%20different%20types%20of%20instruments.) by Edmund C. Sutton, Cambridge University Press, 2011.
    - This book should be also available as an eBook through Tsinghua's library system.

## Attendance Policy 

- This course will not check your attendance during the lectures. Your in person participation is strongly encouraged, but you should prioritize your own schedule. 
- In case that you cannot come to the classroom in person for a valid reason, but you still want to listen to lecture through a telecon service or a video recording, you should let me know first. I will do our best to help.

## Hands-on Section 

- This course will also provide a small, parallel "crash course" about several practical skills required if you want to become a "high-end" amateur astronomer or a professional one. This involves knowing a bunch of cool websites or online tools that can make your life easier, learning a few cross-platform, open source softwares that helps you play with real data just like a sophisticated astronomer.
    - You can find the installers for several of the most useful softwares on this [Tsinghua Cloud link](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/669cfad8531d4d16ab59/)

- The course will also use a hands-on data analysis task as the final project. By default, we use Python programming language in the interactive mode through a wonderful software package called Jupyter. Within a Jupyter notebook, you can load a series of tools (or Python libraries) provided by the community to help you deal with real imaging data of your favorite object. 
    - Python is practically the default language for data science these days. So it doesn't hurt for you to learn a little bit of Python even if you have zero programming background. It is not very difficult. And the course will provide you a demo. 
    - If you believe you can finish the project using a different language, please feel free to do so. 

## Grading Scheme 

- Homework (40%): There will be 5 homework assignments. Each assignment will be worth 7% of the final grade.
    - You will get 5% of Attendance score for _free_. Your in person participation of the lecture is encouraged, but is not a mandate. 
- Midterm (20%): There will be one midterm exam consisting of 20 single-choice questions.
    - To avoid the conflict with other mid-term exams, we will host the exam on **Week 11**.
- Final Project (40%): "hands on" imaging data analysis using Python or any other programming language:
    - If you are using Python, you will provide a Jupyter notebook that can be executed to reproduce the results. 
    - If you are using a different programming language, you will provide the codes & a report to explain what you did.

## Schedule 

- The schedule for the rest of the semester will be updated later. 
- We will provide the links to the slides for the lectures here as well.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is one of the cornerstones of the Tsinghua University. It is critically important both to maintain our community which honours the values of honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility and to protect you, the students within this community, and the value of the degree towards which you are all working so diligently.

Both the teacher and students of this course will follow the guidance of the [Tsinghua University Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/xswyh/info/1018/1019.htm). Any violation, such as cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, interference, and obstruction, will be reported to the Department of Astronomy.
