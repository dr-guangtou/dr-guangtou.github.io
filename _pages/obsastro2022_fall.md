## The Goal of this Course

In the last decade, a series of ground-breaking astronomical discoveries have stepped into the spotlight of science and collected a bucketload of Nobel Physics medals. Do you know which surreal technology enables the confirmation of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy? Can you imagine the challenges astronomers faced when they searched for the first exoplanet? And do you understand the amount of effort behind the observational evidence for "accelerated expansion of the Universe"? "Astronomy is a discipline based on observation." And, in this course, we will show you what it means. 

This course will give you a panoramic view of the landscape of modern astronomical observation, including some of the frontlines of observational astrophysics. We will focus on the optical/infrared observations and cover the basics of the multi-wavelength and multi-messenger sides of the subject. This course will give a basic grasp of fundamental concepts and methods of observational astronomy. You will also taste actual observation and essential data reduction through a small project. 

This course will primarily cover the following four topics: 1. Observation: What is astronomical observation? Why do these observations? What did astronomers in history observe? And what are today's astrophysics targets? 2. Measurement: What are astronomers measuring during the observation? How do they achieve it? What fundamental space, time, and energy reference systems support all the cutting-edge observations? 3. Instrument: What equipment and instruments are essential for modern observation? And which exciting technologies are involved? 4. Methodology: How do the data collected during the observation become "science"? What are the common senses and universal logics in this critical data reduction step?
