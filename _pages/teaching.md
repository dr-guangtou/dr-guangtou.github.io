### Observational Astronomy (2022 Fall)

- This course will provide a panoramic view of the landscape of modern astronomical observation, including some of the frontier fields of observational astrophysics. We will focus on the optical/infrared observations and cover the basics of the multi-wavelength and multi-messenger sides of the subject. This course will give a basic grasp of fundamental concepts and methods of observational astronomy.

- I will share the syllabus and the lectures files here later. Please stay tuned.

### Others

I have spent some time with [`Taotie` (饕餮) - A curated collection of resources for astrophysical research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie). There is also a [Gitlab mirror](https://gitlab.com/dr-guangtou/taotie) if you have difficulty accessing Github. 
The idea is to provide a community "bookmark" for students who want to get started with astronomy. Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. I would really appreciate it!
