## What Are We Doing? 

At Tsinghua, we are working on the study of galaxy formation and evolution using both observations and simulations. We are particularly interested in the formation of massive galaxies and the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We are also interested in the application of machine learning techniques in astronomy.

<br>

## Who Are We? 

My group is a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and interests. We are always looking for new members to join us. If you are interested in working with us, please contact me.
