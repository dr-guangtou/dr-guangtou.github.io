## What Are We Doing? 

At Tsinghua, we study galaxy formation and evolution using observations and simulations. We are particularly interested in the formation of massive galaxies and the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We are also interested in the application of machine learning techniques in astronomy.

<br>

## Who Are We? 

My group includes people from different backgrounds and interests. We are always looking for new members. If you are interested in working with us, please contact me.

### Undergraduate Students

> We have interesting projects for undergraduate students at different levels or with various backgrounds. These projects focus on analyzing observational and simulation data. Please feel free to reach out if you are curious! 
> 课题组面向不同背景和学习阶段的本科生提供科研实践项目，涉及观测或者数值模拟数据的分析。如果你感到好奇，欢迎联系我！

> We can also offer internships for engineering or computer science students to work on various aspects of the MUST project, such as the spectrograph, the focal plane & fiber systems, the scientific forecast and survey planning, and more! If you want to participate in the exciting (and challenging) early-stage development of the (probably) world's first Stage-V spectroscopic survey telescope, these could be great opportunities.
> 我们还能为工程或计算机背景的学生提供参与MUST望远镜项目的实习机会。你将有机会参与MUST的光谱仪、焦面与光纤系统、科学预测与巡天规划等项目。如果你有兴趣为(很可能是)世界上首个第五阶段宇宙学光谱巡天项目激动人心(同时又无比挑战)的早期建设阶段作出贡献，请联系我们！
