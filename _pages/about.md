**This website is like my career. It is still (and probably will always be) under construction!!**

My name is Song Huang (黄崧). I am an associate professor (but I am still not tenured...fingers crossed) at the Department of Astronomy at Tsinghua University, China.  You can find [my CV here](https://dr-guangtou.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) or check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/dr-guangtou).

My primary research interest is the observational study of galaxy evolution and galaxy-halo connection. Most of my works take advantage of today's multi-band imaging data, spectroscopic surveys, and hydrodynamic simulations to probe the structure assembly and star formation history of different classes of galaxies. I have a group of [excellent students at Tsinghua now](https://dr-guangtou.github.io/group/), and we welcome collaborations! 

My recent works focus on the most massive (elliptical) and most abundant (dwarf galaxies) galaxies in our universe. Using weak gravitational lensing and statistical modeling techniques, I aspire to deepen our understanding of galaxy-halo connection models and explore their applications in observational cosmology.

I am a member of the [Subaru Strategic Program (SSP)](https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/) using the [Hyper-Suprime Camera (HSC)](https://www.naoj.org/Projects/HSC/) on the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope and the [Merian Survey](https://merian.sites.ucsc.edu/) - an intermediate-band survey of the HSC footprint using the [Dark Energy Camera (DECam)](https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/instruments/Dark-Energy-Camera). Recently, I have also joined the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) spectroscopic survey project.

At Tsinghua, we are building an ambitious 6.5-meter telescope called [MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST)](https://must.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/must/) for the next-generation spectroscopic survey. I am currently the co-project scientist helping organize MUST's scientific collaboration.

I am always happy to discuss science and collaborate with people. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions.
